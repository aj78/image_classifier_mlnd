This project creates an Image classifier using PyTorch.
By applying transfer learning and using Densenet and Resnet models
avalable in Torchvision, and modifying the classifier, a new model
is created. Checkpoints are created from the models and command line
utility is built to reconstruct the model from the checkpoint and 
make a prediction about images. The images in this project are 102
different types of flowers.
